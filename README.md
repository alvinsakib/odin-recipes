Now I am writing a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills I will have demonstrated once I have completed it.

This project is to demonstrate the HTML knowledge I have learnt so far! This is my first Web development practical with git and github.

# What I have Learnt in this project
1. Basic HTML syntax
    a) HTML
    b) head
    c) body
    d) h1>h2>h3>h4>h5>h6
    e) ul,ol
    f) li
    g) p
    h) br
    i) a
    j) img
    k) link
    l) button
    m) div
    n) section

2. Basic CSS Syntax


3. Basic Git 

    i) Now it’s time to clone your repository from GitHub into your newly created repos directory with git clone followed by the URL you copied in the last step. The full command should look similar to git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
    ii) We will open the directory in Visual Studio Code by using the command 'code .' inside your repository.
    iii) You can use 'git add .' to add all files in the current directory and all subsequent directories to the staging area. Then, type 'git status' once more, and everything should now be in the staging area.
    iv) Finally, let’s commit all of the files that are in the staging area and add a descriptive commit message. 'git commit -m "Your Commit Message". Then, type 'git status' once again, which will output the same “nothing to commit” message.
    v) Take one last look at your commit history by typing 'git log'.
    vi) Type 'git push'. To be more specific, type 'git push origin main'. Since you are not dealing with another branch (other than main) or a different remote, you can leave it as git push to save a few keystrokes. 
    vii) Type 'git status' one final time. It should output “Your branch is up to date with ‘origin/main’. nothing to commit, working tree clean”.
    viii) Also check this sites (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-git-basics) to know more about git.
